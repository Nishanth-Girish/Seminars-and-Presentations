2. Comparative Analysis of Performances of Different Machine Learning Models Applied to the World Happiness Report 2022 Data:
A comparative analysis of performances of different machine learning models applied to the World Happiness Report 2022 was studied. Various regression models and a neural network model was fitted to see which model performs best and which model can be used to predict future happiness scores. The analysis was done using R software.
